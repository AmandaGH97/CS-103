        The history of Halloween can be traced back over two thousand years to the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain (pronounced "sow-in"). Samhain marked the end of the harvest season and the beginning of winter, a time often associated with death in Celtic culture. It was believed that on the night of October 31st, the boundary between the living and the dead blurred, allowing spirits to roam the earth.<br>
        <br>
        During Samhain, Celts would light bonfires and wear costumes made of animal skins to ward off ghosts. They also left offerings of food and drink outside their homes to appease the spirits. Additionally, Druids, Celtic priests, would make predictions about the future during this time.<br>
        <br>
        When the Romans conquered the Celtic territories, they incorporated some of the Celtic traditions into their own festivals. One such festival was Feralia, which honored the passing of the dead. Another was a day to honor Pomona, the Roman goddess of fruit and trees, whose symbol was the apple. This is thought to be the origin of the tradition of bobbing for apples, which became associated with Halloween.<br>
        <br>
        Christianity spread throughout the Roman Empire, and in the 7th century AD, Pope Boniface IV established All Saints' Day, also known as All Hallows' Day, on November 1st. This was followed by All Souls' Day on November 2nd. The evening before All Hallows' Day became known as All Hallows' Eve, eventually evolving into Halloween.<br>
        <br>
        In the Middle Ages, Halloween was still largely a pagan festival, but some Christian customs were incorporated, such as souling and guising. Souling involved going door-to-door asking for soul cakes in exchange for prayers for the dead, while guising involved dressing up in costumes and performing tricks in exchange for food and drink.<br>
        <br>
        When Irish and Scottish immigrants brought their Halloween customs to North America in the 19th century, the holiday began to evolve into the secular, community-centered event we know today. Trick-or-treating became a widespread tradition, and Halloween parties and parades became popular.<br>
        <br>
        Over time, Halloween has become a commercialized holiday with traditions like carving pumpkins, decorating homes with spooky decorations, and watching horror films. However, its roots in ancient Celtic and Christian rituals still influence many of the customs practiced today.<br>
