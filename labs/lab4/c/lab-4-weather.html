    <p>The weather in Boston varies greatly throughout the year, experiencing all four distinct seasons.<br>
        <br>
        Spring (March to May): Spring in Boston brings milder temperatures and the gradual emergence of foliage and flowers. However, it can still be quite unpredictable, with occasional chilly days and sporadic rain showers. Average temperatures range from around 40°F (4°C) in March to 60°F (16°C) in May.<br>
        <br>
        Summer (June to August): Summer is typically warm and humid in Boston, with temperatures ranging from the 70s to the 90s Fahrenheit (21°C to 35°C). July tends to be the hottest month, with occasional heatwaves pushing temperatures even higher. Summer also brings frequent afternoon thunderstorms, though they are usually brief.<br>
        <br>
        Fall (September to November): Fall in Boston is characterized by crisp, cool weather and vibrant foliage as the leaves change color. Average temperatures gradually decrease from the 70s Fahrenheit (around 21°C) in September to the 50s Fahrenheit (around 10-15°C) in November. Fall is generally considered one of the most picturesque seasons in Boston, attracting many visitors for leaf-peeping and outdoor activities.<br>
        <br>
        Winter (December to February): Winter in Boston can be cold and snowy, with temperatures often dropping below freezing. Average temperatures range from the 20s to 30s Fahrenheit (-6°C to -1°C), though occasional cold snaps can bring temperatures even lower. Snowfall is common during the winter months, with January typically being the snowiest month. However, winters in Boston can also experience periods of milder weather, known as "January thaws," when temperatures briefly rise above freezing.<br>
