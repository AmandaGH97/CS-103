            <p> The North Atlantic Ocean's coastal waters are home to gray seals.
                Their huge, curving noses have earned them the nickname "horseheads";
                adult males in particular have big, horse-like heads.
                Large groups of gray seals congregate during the molting and breeding seasons.
                Aside from this, they frequently coexist in the same habitat as harbor seals.
                The Marine Mammal Protection Act provides protection for gray seals, as it does for all other marine mammals.
                Gray seal conservation and protection are top priorities for NOAA Fisheries.
                To investigate, understand more about, and safeguard this species, our scientists
                and collaborators employ a range of cutting-edge methods.</p> <!-- I found this information on this website "https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/species/gray-seal"-->

            <h1>Fun Facts</h1>
            <p>
                Gray seals grow to a maximum length of 10 feet (3 m) and weight of 880 pounds (400 kg).<br>
                <br>
                Gray seals live for 25 to 35 years.<br>
                <br>
                Female gray seals are gray with black spots while males are black with gray spots.<br>
                <br>
                The gray seal’s scientific name, Halichoerus grypus, translates to “hooked-nosed pig of the sea,” in reference to the male’s distinct, horse-shaped nose.<br>
                <br>
                Gray seals dive underwater for a maximum time of 30 minutes.<br>
                <br>
                Gray seals typically dive in shallow waters but have been recorded diving down to 1,352 feet (412 m) in some areas.<br>
                <br>
                Gray seals can spend more than two days out at sea foraging for food.2<br> <!-- I found this fun facts about the gray seal on this website "https://oceana.org/marine-life/gray-seal/"-->

            <h1>Behavior and Diet</h1>
            <div id="bh">
                <p>Large groups of gray seals congregate during the molting and breeding seasons.
                    They can be found alone, in small groups, or in big aggregations on land or at sea for the remainder of the year.
                    Gray seals may submerge for up to an hour at a depth of 1,560 feet.
                    They can consume four to six percent of their body weight in food on average each day,
                    although they abstain from eating during the molting and mating seasons.
                    Their keen hearing and vision enable them to be adept hunters.
                    They hunt in packs a lot, which facilitates their ability to capture prey.
                    They consume crustaceans, squid, octopuses, fish (mainly sand eels, hake, whiting,
                    cod, haddock, pollock, and flatfish), and occasionally seabirds.
                    Their diet varies by age class, sex, season, and geographic region.</p> <!-- I found this information on this website "https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/species/gray-seal"-->

                <h1>Gray Seal Appearance</h1>
                <p>Members of the "true" seal family include gray seals.<br>
                    All real seals have small flippers that they utilize to walk on land like "caterpillars."<br>
                    Their ear flaps are not external. Gray seal adults can grow to be up to 10 feet long and weigh over 880 pounds,<br>
                    while mature females measure about 7.5 feet long and weigh approximately 550 pounds.<br>
                    Males have dark gray or brown fur with sporadic dark patches that may or may not be silver-gray,<br>
                    while females have brown or silver-gray fur. In addition, men's noses are longer than women's.<br>
                    <br>
                    Because of how unusual the male gray seal's nose is,<br>
                    Halichoerus grypus, the official name for the species,<br>
                    translates to "hooked-nosed pig of the sea."<br>
                    Puppies of gray seals have white fur, or lanugo.<br>
                    The pups' white fur helps retain heat by absorbing sunlight.<br>
                    The evolutionary history of the lanugo is likewise connected to that of other ice-breeding seals.<br>
                    In certain regions of Canada (the Gulf of St.<br>
                    Lawrence, Sable Island, and Nova Scotia), as well as on rocky or sandy beaches<br>
                    or islands in the United States and some areas of the Baltic Sea, gray seals breed.<br>
                    About three weeks after birth, puppies start to lose their lanugo. <!-- I found this information on this website "https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/species/gray-seal"-->

            <div id="population">
            <h1>Population Status and Where they live</h1>
            <p>There is only one gray seal stock in American waters,<br>
                and that is the western North Atlantic stock.<br>
                In combined seas of the United States and Canada,<br>
                there are about 450,000 gray seals.<br>
                You can read our stock assessment reports for more information about the methodology used<br>
                to determine stock abundance in the United States and Canada.<br>
                <br>
                Gray seals can be found in coastal regions from the mid-Atlantic to the Baltic Sea in the North Atlantic Ocean.<br>
                Gray seals are found in three different stocks around the world:<br>
                the Baltic Sea stock, the eastern North Atlantic stock (which includes Great Britain,<br>
                Iceland, Norway, Denmark, the Faroe Islands, and Russia),<br>
                and the western North Atlantic stock, which includes<br>
                eastern Canada and the northeastern United States.<br>
                Sandbars, ice shelves, islands, rugged beaches, and icebergs are all home to gray seals.<br>
                They frequently reside in the same places as harbor seals and share habitat with numerous other species. <!-- I found this information on this website "https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/species/gray-seal"--><br>

            </p>

            <h1>Gray Seal Lifespan and Reproduction</h1>
            <p>The lifespan of a gray seal is 25–35 years.<br>
                To mate, they congregate in big groups. In a single breeding season,<br>
                males that breed on land might mate with numerous different females.<br>
                After roughly 11 months of pregnancy, females give birth to a single puppy.<br>
                While females in the western Atlantic Ocean give birth in December and February,<br>
                those in the eastern Atlantic Ocean give birth between September and November.<br>
                In the Baltic, women give birth in March.<br>
                Newborn gray seals weigh approximately 35 pounds at birth.<br>
                They spend roughly three weeks nursing on high-fat milk.<br>
                They put on a thick layer of blubber during this stage,<br>
                and they grow roughly three pounds every day.<br>
                Puppy gray seals are quite talkative.<br>
                Their cries sometimes sound like a human baby crying.<br>
                This is normal behavior that helps mothers find their pups on crowded beaches<br>
                when they return to the shore from foraging.<br>
                Moms don’t feed while nursing pups. <!-- I found this information on this website "https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/species/gray-seal"--><br>
